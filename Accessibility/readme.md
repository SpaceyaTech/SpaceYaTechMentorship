> The power of the Web is in its universality. Access by everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect. - *Sir Timothy Berners-Lee, W3C Director and inventor of the World Wide Web*

## What is accessibility?

Accessibility is the practice of making your websites usable by as many people as possible — we traditionally think of this as being about people with disabilities, but really it also includes many other groups such as those using mobile devices, or those with slow network connections.

## Why is accessibility important?

Accessibility is important because it ensures that people with disabilities can use the Web. Disabilities can be permanent, temporary, or situational. For example, a person with a broken arm may not be able to use a mouse, or a person with a slow connection may not be able to stream video.

## What is the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)?

The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) are a set of guidelines published by the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). The WCAGs explain how to make web content more accessible to people with disabilities. The WCAGs are not laws, but many countries base their accessibility laws on them, and they are used by many organizations to help make their web content more accessible.

## What is the difference between accessibility and usability?

Accessibility is about making your websites usable by as many people as possible. Usability is about making your websites easy to use and easy to learn.

## What is the difference between accessibility and inclusive design?

Accessibility is about making your websites usable by as many people as possible. Inclusive design is about designing for a diverse range of people, including those with disabilities.

## What is the difference between accessibility and assistive technology?

Accessibility is about making your websites usable by as many people as possible. Assistive technology is about providing technology to people with disabilities to help them use the Web.

## What is the difference between accessibility and universal design?

Accessibility is about making your websites usable by as many people as possible. Universal design is about designing products and environments to be usable by as many people as possible without the need for adaptation or specialized design.

### 1. Use semantic HTML

Semantic HTML is HTML that clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer. Using semantic HTML helps both humans and machines to understand the content of your web pages. For example, a `<section>` element clearly represents a section of content, and a `<table>` element clearly represents tabular data.

### 2. Use ARIA

Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) is a set of attributes that define ways to make web content and web applications (especially those developed with JavaScript) more accessible to people with disabilities. ARIA defines ways to make a web page more accessible for people with disabilities such as blindness and low vision, deafness and hearing loss, speech disabilities, photosensitivity, and combinations of these, by supplementing the information conveyed to assistive technologies.

### 3. Use headings

Headings are used to organize the content of a web page. Headings are used to indicate the structure of a web page, and to allow users to navigate the page using a screen reader. Headings are also used to indicate the structure of a web page to search engines, which can use this information to provide better search results.

### 4. Use labels

Labels are used to identify form controls such as text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, and buttons. Labels are used to identify form controls to screen readers, which can use this information to provide better navigation of forms. Labels are also used to identify form controls to search engines, which can use this information to provide better search results.

### 5. Use alt text

Alt text is used to provide a text alternative for non-text content such as images, audio, and video. Alt text is used to provide a text alternative to screen readers, which can use this information to provide better navigation of content. Alt text is also used to provide a text alternative to search engines, which can use this information to provide better search results.

### 6. Use color safe palettes

Color safe palettes are color palettes that have been designed to be accessible to people with color vision deficiencies. Color safe palettes are used to ensure that people with color vision deficiencies can see the content of your web pages.

### 7. Use high contrast palettes

High contrast palettes are color palettes that have been designed to be accessible to people with low vision. High contrast palettes are used to ensure that people with low vision can see the content of your web pages.

### 8. Use high contrast mode

High contrast mode is a setting that can be used to increase the contrast between the foreground and background of a web page. High contrast mode is used to ensure that people with low vision can see the content of your web pages.
