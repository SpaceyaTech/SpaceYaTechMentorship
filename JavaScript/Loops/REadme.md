## Loops in JavaScript

Loops are used to repeat a block of code a certain number of times. Types of loops in JavaScript:

- `for` - loops through a block of code a number of times
- `for/in` - loops through the properties of an object
- `while` - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true
- `do/while` - also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true

- `break` - breaks out of a loop
- `continue` - continues a loop
- `forEach` - loops through the elements of an array
